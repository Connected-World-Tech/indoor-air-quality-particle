      The recommended temperatures are related to mold growth, not personal comfort.
      If you find that household members have symptoms as the temperature rises - 
      lowering the temperature can help to reduce symptoms.
      <br/><br/>
      Reducing temperatures (and adding more clothes when needed) can help when there is a mold problem.
      The VOC's emitted by mold particles will offgas less at lower temperatures.
